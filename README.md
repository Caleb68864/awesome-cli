## How to contribute?

First of all: _Everything_ is a folder. We do not list simple links here, we
_collect_ data. This means: Each tool gets its own folder, and in the markdown
files in this folder, we collect information.

Standard files per directory:

* index.md - The "Home"-page for the tool, list basic information here
* external.md - A list of external resources not available in this repository.
  Explain each resource!

All other files are optional, but I suggest files like `config.md` for cool
configuration tips for the tools and `combining.md` for combining the tool with
other tools.

Another thing is: As we categorize all the things (and categories are single
words, not something like `"Archives and Compression"`), we use symlinks for
putting tools in two categories at once. Always put a tool which should be in
two categories into the category which comes alphabetically first!

The special directory `__incoming` contains folders for tools which are not
yet sorted.
